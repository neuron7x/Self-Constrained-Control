# Security Policy

This project is a simulation + orchestration scaffold.

If you discover a security issue:
- Do **not** open a public issue with exploit details.
- Open a private report via repository security advisories (preferred), or contact the maintainer.

Scope:
- Supply chain (dependency pinning, integrity)
- Unsafe deserialization / state persistence
- Arbitrary code execution via configuration, scripts, or plugins
